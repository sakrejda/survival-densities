China is a major contributor to the worldwide infectious disease burden because of its population size. The association of China with the rest of the world through travel and trade means that events in the country can affect distant populations. The ecological interaction of people with animals in China favours the emergence of new microbial threats. The public-health system has to be prepared to deal with the challenges of newly emerging infectious diseases and at the same time try to control existing diseases. To address the microbial threats, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, the government has committed substantial resources to the implementation of new strategies, including the development of a real-time monitoring system as part of the infectious-disease surveillance. This strategy can serve as a model for worldwide surveillance and response to threats from infectious diseases. "

	abstract = {Formal, quantitative approaches are now widely used to make predictions about the likelihood of an infectious disease outbreak, how the disease will spread, and how to control it. Several well-established methodologies are available, including risk factor analysis, risk modelling and dynamic modelling. Even so, predictive modelling is very much the {\textquoteleft}art of the possible{\textquoteright}, which tends to drive research effort towards some areas and away from others which may be at least as important. Building on the undoubted success of quantitative modelling of the epidemiology and control of human and animal diseases such as AIDS, influenza, foot-and-mouth disease and BSE, attention needs to be paid to developing a more holistic framework that captures the role of the underlying drivers of disease risks, from demography and behaviour to land use and climate change. At the same time, there is still considerable room for improvement in how quantitative analyses and their outputs are communicated to policy makers and other stakeholders. A starting point would be generally accepted guidelines for {\textquoteleft}good practice{\textquoteright} for the development and the use of predictive models.},

  year = {2014},
  abstract = {Last year was difficult for Google Flu Trends (GFT). In early 2013, Nature reported that GFT was estimating more than double the percentage of doctor visits for influenza like illness than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s (CDC) sentinel reports during the 2012 2013 flu season (1). Given that GFT was designed to forecast upcoming CDC reports, this was a problematic finding. In March 2014, our report in Science found that the overestimation problem in GFT was also present in the 2011 2012 flu season (2). The report also found strong evidence of autocorrelation and seasonality in the GFT errors, and presented evidence that the issues were likely, at least in part, due to modifications made by Google s search algorithm and the decision by GFT engineers not to use previous CDC reports or seasonality estimates in their models   what the article labeled  algorithm dynamics  and  big data hubris  respectively. Moreover, the report and the supporting online materials detailed how difficult/impossible it is to replicate the GFT results, undermining independent efforts to explore the source of GFT errors and formulate improvements.},

In February 2013, Google Flu Trends (GFT) made headlines but not for a reason that Google executives or the creators of the flu tracking system would have hoped. Nature reported that GFT was predicting more than double the proportion of doctor visits for influenza-like illness (ILI) than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which bases its estimates on surveillance reports from laboratories across the United States ( 1, 2). This happened despite the fact that GFT was built to predict CDC reports. Given that GFT is often held up as an exemplary use of big data ( 3, 4), what lessons can we draw from this error?},

    abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Predicting the course of infectious disease outbreaks in real-time is a challenging task. It requires knowledge of the particular disease system as well as a pipeline that can turn raw data from a public health surveillance system into calibrated predictions of disease incidence. Dengue is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that places an immense public health and economic burden upon countries around the world, especially in tropical areas. In 2014 our research team, a collaboration of the Ministry of Public Health of Thailand and academic researchers from the United States, implemented a system for generating real-time forecasts of dengue hemorrhagic fever based on the disease surveillance reports from Thailand. We compared predictions from several different statistical models, identifying locations and times where our predictions were accurate. We also quantified the extent to which delayed reporting of cases in real-time impacted our predictions. Broadly speaking, improving real-time predictions can enable more targeted, timely interventions and risk communication, both of which have a measurable impact on disease spread in epidemic and pandemic scenarios. It is vital that we continue to build knowledge about the best ways to make these forecasts and integrate them into public health decision making.</p>},
